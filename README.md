## Code Architecture
### Model
Represents the database relationship entities.

### Repository
Manages the underlying data storage and provides an interface for interacting with it.

### Service
Intermediary between the API endpoints and the repository layer. Itâ€™s responsible for implementing business logic, orchestrating interactions between different repositories, and performing necessary validations or additional operations.

### Routers
API endpoints using FastAPI routers.
